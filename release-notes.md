# Release Notes - Solar Plate Auto-Cleaning System

## Version 1.0.0 (Initial Release)

**Release Date:** April 23, 2025

### Key Features

- **Automated Cleaning:** Detects dust accumulation and automatically initiates cleaning cycles
- **Weather Detection:** Includes rain sensing to prevent cleaning during rainfall
- **Configurable:** Easy-to-adjust parameters in config.h
- **Dual Operation Modes:** Support for both dry and wet cleaning methods
- **Power Efficient:** Optimized to operate on solar power with minimal consumption
- **IoT Capability:** Optional web dashboard and MQTT connectivity for remote monitoring and control
- **OTA Updates:** Support for over-the-air firmware updates for ESP32 boards

### Components Supported

- Arduino Uno / Nano / Mega
- ESP32 Development Boards
- Common sensors:
  - LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) for dust detection
  - Rain detection sensor
  - Optional additional sensors

### Installation Instructions

1. Upload the main.ino sketch to your Arduino board
2. For IoT functionality, upload dashboard.ino to an ESP32 board
3. Connect sensors and actuators according to the documentation
4. Adjust parameters in config.h to match your specific setup

### Known Issues

- Dust detection may need calibration based on local environmental conditions
- The current implementation has been tested primarily in dry environments
- Motor control timing may need adjustment for different cleaning mechanism designs

### Future Plans

- Enhanced dust detection algorithms
- Support for automated scheduling based on time of day
- Mobile application for remote control
- Integration with smart home systems (HomeAssistant, etc.)
- Machine learning model to predict optimal cleaning times
